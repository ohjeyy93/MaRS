## Follow the basic steps as outlined in the [SRA Submission Quick Start](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/submit/)
1. Sign in to you NCBI account
2. Register your biological samples at the [BioSample database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/) under BioProject PRJNA428490 (The MaRS BioProject).
3. Create a new SRA data submission and submit your SRA metadata file
4. Follow the prompts on the screen to upload your files, selecting the Aspera option.
5. Upload sequence files using Aspera Connect via command line (see below) or [SRA fle upload options](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/submitfiles/)

    * In the command line run the export PATH command printed on your screen from output from the shell script
2. Download the aspera key from the link provided in the SRA submission portal prompting you to upload your files
3. Make sure all of your sequence files are grouped together in the same directory with no other files
4. Run the following command in the command line
    * ascp -i <path/to/key\_file> -QT -m 1100 -k 1 -d <path/to/folder\_with\_files(s)> subasp@upload.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:<destination directory as provided on the SRA submission screen>
